# Development

How the workspace is laid out, how to build it on each platform, and how to add an
instrument or an effect.

## Layout

```
BACKEND — no UI dependency of any kind
  crates/auris-core     types, plugin traits, project model — no local dependencies at all
  crates/auris-dsp      effects and DSP primitives
  crates/auris-synth    built-in instruments
  crates/auris-sampler  SoundFont playback: the font bank and the sampler instrument
  crates/auris-engine   render graph, transport, cpal output, offline renderer
  crates/auris-io       audio file import/export, project save/load
  crates/auris-gpu      wgpu compute for offline analysis
  crates/auris-compose  score-based automatic composition: a text spec in, notes out
  crates/auris-i18n     interface text in every language, and nothing else
  crates/auris-session  the document, the engine and every command a frontend needs

FRONTEND
  crates/auris-gpui     the desktop application  (binary: auris-studio)
  crates/auris-cli      the command line tool    (binary: auris)
```

Dependencies run strictly downhill and the boundary is enforced by what each crate is allowed
to name. `auris-core` depends on nothing local. `auris-engine` does *not* depend on
`auris-dsp`, `auris-synth` or `auris-sampler` — it drives plugins purely through the
`auris-core` traits, which is what keeps the plugin system honest. And `auris-gpui` depends on
`auris-session` and gpui
and nothing else in the workspace: if it ever needs `auris-engine` directly, something that
belongs in the session layer has leaked into the UI.

### What lives where

Keeping the *rendering* backend UI-free is the easy part. The piece that usually leaks is the
orchestration around it — building the registry, rebuilding the render graph after an edit,
deciding which changes need a whole new graph and which fit in a command, tracking undo,
resolving a parameter to the plugin that owns it. All of that is in `auris-session`, so a
second frontend reuses it instead of reimplementing it slightly differently.

Gestures are handled with transactions: a pointer drag opens one, makes as many edits as it
likes, and closes it. The result is one undo step and one graph rebuild — and none of either
when the drag changed nothing.

## Building on each platform

### Windows

Nothing to install beyond the Rust toolchain — audio goes through WASAPI and the window is
drawn by gpui's DirectX renderer, both of which come with the system.

Two differences are worth knowing about. Commands bound to ⌘ on macOS are bound to Ctrl here,
including the ⌘-click that places a note; the settings window shows whichever the keyboard in
front of it has. And the menu bar is drawn inside the window rather than by the system, because
Windows has no system menu bar to draw it.

wgpu's Direct3D 12 backend is switched off, so `auris-gpu` runs on Vulkan. It is optional
offline analysis and steps aside when no backend is present, so a machine with neither still
works — everything simply runs on the CPU. The backend does not compile at these versions:
`gpu-allocator` asks for `windows = ">=0.53, <=0.62"`, gpui pins `^0.61`, so the range resolves
to 0.61 while `wgpu-hal` itself uses 0.62 and the two disagree about what an `ID3D12Device` is.
Worth revisiting when either crate moves.

### macOS without a full Xcode install

gpui normally compiles its Metal shaders at build time by shelling out to `xcrun metal`, which
lives inside Xcode and is unreachable while `xcode-select -p` points at the Command Line
Tools. This project enables gpui's `runtime_shaders` feature instead, which compiles them
through the Metal framework at start-up — so the Command Line Tools are enough.

Nothing to configure; it is already set in `Cargo.toml`, and it is worth keeping even with
Xcode installed. The cost is one shader compile at launch; the benefit is that the project
builds on a machine without a 15 GB download.

## Adding a sound source

Implement two traits and register a factory. That is the whole procedure.

```rust
use auris_core::prelude::*;

struct MySynth { /* ... */ }

impl Parameterized for MySynth {
    fn parameters(&self) -> &[ParamDescriptor] { /* ... */ }
    fn param(&self, id: ParamId) -> f32 { /* ... */ }
    fn set_param(&mut self, id: ParamId, value: f32) { /* ... */ }
}

impl Instrument for MySynth {
    fn descriptor(&self) -> PluginDescriptor {
        PluginDescriptor::instrument(
            "mine.synth.example",
            "Example",
            "A worked example",
            PluginCategory::Synth,
        )
    }
    fn prepare(&mut self, ctx: &PrepareContext) { /* allocate here */ }
    fn reset(&mut self) { /* ... */ }
    fn process(&mut self, events: &[NoteEvent], out: &mut AudioBuffer, ctx: &ProcessContext) {
        /* never allocate here */
    }
}

registry.register_instrument(|| Box::new(MySynth::new()));
```

The parameters you declare become UI controls automatically, with the right widget, range,
unit and scaling — the editor is generated from `ParamDescriptor`, not hand-written per plugin.
Effects work identically through the `Effect` trait.

## The commands

```bash
cargo test --workspace                    # unit tests
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets    # lints
cargo fmt --all                           # formatting
cargo doc --workspace --no-deps --open    # the API documentation
```

Every crate carries `#![warn(missing_docs)]` and CI builds the documentation with warnings denied,
so a public item without a doc comment and a link that does not resolve are both build failures.

The workspace has no root crate, so the account of how the twelve of them fit together lives in
`auris_session::guide` — it is the only crate that depends on every other, and so the only one
whose links to them all resolve. It covers the architecture and the layering rules, the realtime
contract, writing a plugin (with a worked example that is compiled as a test), the composition
format, and where the two platforms differ.
