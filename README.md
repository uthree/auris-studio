# Auris Studio

A DAW for the AI Era — a digital audio workstation written in Rust, with a GPU-rendered
interface built on [gpui](https://crates.io/crates/gpui), the UI framework behind the Zed
editor.

Auris Studio is designed around one idea: **a sound source is just a trait implementation.**
Instruments and effects describe their own parameters, register themselves by id, and the
engine and UI pick them up without knowing anything else about them.

## Status

Early but functional. The pieces below work end to end: write notes in the piano roll, play
them through a built-in synth, shape them with effects, and render the result to a WAV file.

## Features

### Tracks

* **Instrument tracks** — notes on a timeline, played by a software instrument.
* **Audio tracks** — imported audio, arranged as clips with trim, gain and fades.

### Built-in instruments

Deliberately simple chiptune voices, enough to hear the engine working:

| Id | Name | What it is |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `auris.synth.chiptune` | Chiptune | Sine / square / saw / triangle / LFSR noise with pulse width, ADSR, glide, unison and bit-crush |
| `auris.synth.fm2` | FM 2-Op | A two-operator FM voice, included to show a different synthesis method dropping in unchanged |
| `auris.synth.noisedrum` | Noise Drum | Pitch-swept noise through a band-pass, for percussion |

Square and saw are PolyBLEP band-limited, so high notes stay clean instead of aliasing.

### Built-in effects

| Id | Name | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `auris.fx.gain` | Gain & Pan | Constant-power pan law, stereo width, phase invert |
| `auris.fx.eq` | Equalizer | Six bands (HP, low shelf, two peaks, high shelf, LP) with a live response curve |
| `auris.fx.compressor` | Compressor | Soft knee, gain-reduction metering |
| `auris.fx.delay` | Delay | Ping-pong, damped feedback |
| `auris.fx.reverb` | Reverb | Freeverb-style comb/all-pass network |
| `auris.fx.distortion` | Distortion | Soft clip, hard clip, wavefolder, bitcrusher |
| `auris.fx.limiter` | Limiter | Lookahead, so the ceiling is actually a ceiling |

Effects can be chained on any track and on the master bus.

### Export

Render the whole project to a WAV file at 16-bit, 24-bit or 32-bit float, faster than
realtime. The renderer keeps going past the last clip for as long as the longest effect tail,
so reverb and delay decay naturally instead of being cut off.

### GPU acceleration

`auris-gpu` runs the large, embarrassingly parallel offline reductions on the GPU through
[wgpu](https://wgpu.rs): waveform min/max/RMS extraction for clip drawing, and whole-file
loudness analysis. Every kernel has a CPU fallback, and the application runs correctly with no
GPU present.

Realtime per-block DSP deliberately stays on the CPU — a round trip to the GPU costs more
latency than an entire audio block is allowed to take.

## Building

```bash
cargo run --release
```

### macOS without a full Xcode install

gpui normally compiles its Metal shaders at build time by shelling out to `xcrun metal`, which
lives inside Xcode and is unreachable while `xcode-select -p` points at the Command Line
Tools. This project enables gpui's `runtime_shaders` feature instead, which compiles them
through the Metal framework at start-up — so the Command Line Tools are enough.

Nothing to configure; it is already set in `Cargo.toml`, and it is worth keeping even with
Xcode installed. The cost is one shader compile at launch; the benefit is that the project
builds on a machine without a 15 GB download.

## Layout

```
crates/auris-core     types, plugin traits, project model — no backend dependencies
crates/auris-dsp      effects and DSP primitives
crates/auris-synth    built-in instruments
crates/auris-engine   render graph, transport, cpal output, offline renderer
crates/auris-io       audio file import/export, project save/load
crates/auris-gpu      wgpu compute for offline analysis
src/                  the gpui application
```

Dependencies run strictly downhill: `auris-core` depends on nothing local, every other crate
depends on it, and only the binary depends on all of them. Notably `auris-engine` does *not*
depend on `auris-dsp` or `auris-synth` — it drives plugins purely through the `auris-core`
traits, which is what keeps the plugin system honest.

## Adding a sound source

Implement two traits and register a factory. That is the whole procedure.

```rust
use auris_core::prelude::*;

struct MySynth { /* ... */ }

impl Parameterized for MySynth {
    fn parameters(&self) -> &[ParamDescriptor] { /* ... */ }
    fn param(&self, id: ParamId) -> f32 { /* ... */ }
    fn set_param(&mut self, id: ParamId, value: f32) { /* ... */ }
}

impl Instrument for MySynth {
    fn descriptor(&self) -> PluginDescriptor {
        PluginDescriptor::instrument(
            "mine.synth.example",
            "Example",
            "A worked example",
            PluginCategory::Synth,
        )
    }
    fn prepare(&mut self, ctx: &PrepareContext) { /* allocate here */ }
    fn reset(&mut self) { /* ... */ }
    fn process(&mut self, events: &[NoteEvent], out: &mut AudioBuffer, ctx: &ProcessContext) {
        /* never allocate here */
    }
}

registry.register_instrument(|| Box::new(MySynth::new()));
```

The parameters you declare become UI controls automatically, with the right widget, range,
unit and scaling — the editor is generated from `ParamDescriptor`, not hand-written per plugin.
Effects work identically through the `Effect` trait.

## Known limitations

Honest list of what is not there yet, so nobody discovers these the hard way:

* **No plugin delay compensation.** `Effect::latency_frames` is reported but not acted on, so
  a latency-introducing effect shifts its track against the others. Every built-in effect is
  zero-latency except the limiter.
* **Effect tails take the maximum, not the sum.** A delay feeding a reverb exports a shorter
  tail than it should.
* **Audio sources are assumed to be at the render rate.** Import resamples to the project rate,
  but if the output device runs at a different rate the engine does not resample again.
* **Mute is a hard gate.** Toggling it during playback steps to zero within one sample rather
  than ramping, which can click.
* **Seeking into overlapping notes of the same pitch** re-triggers one note, so the first
  following note-off cuts it short.
* **No recording.** Audio tracks hold imported material only.

## Development

```bash
cargo test --workspace                    # unit tests
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets    # lints
cargo fmt --all                           # formatting
```
